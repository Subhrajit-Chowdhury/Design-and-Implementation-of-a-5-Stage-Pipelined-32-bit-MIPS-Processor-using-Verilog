# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-5-Stage-Pipelined-32-bit-MIPS-Processor-using-Verilog
An educational Verilog-based implementation of a 5-stage pipelined MIPS processor, simulating the instruction flow through standard MIPS stages: IF, ID, EX, MEM, and WB. This project is designed to help understand pipelined architecture and hazards in RISC-based processors.
5 Pipeline Stages: Implements all five classical MIPS pipeline stages:

Instruction Fetch (IF)
Instruction Decode/Register Fetch (ID)
Execute (EX)
Memory Access (MEM)
Write Back (WB)
